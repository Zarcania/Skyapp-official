The AI engineer successfully developed SkyApp from an initial MVP, focusing on iterative design refinement and significant feature additions. Initially, the project revolved around professional PDF generation, enhanced photo management (drag-and-drop, geo-localization), and dynamic forms. A major refactoring involved modularizing  into  to resolve integration issues, followed by implementing detailed worksite planning features.

The recent work began with enhancing the landing page, introducing animations and a Coming Soon section with an AI orb. The user then shifted focus from a Spline-based orb to a comprehensive redesign of the application's visual identity and core sections. This included replacing the logo, extensive typography changes to Space Grotesk, refining the About Us section with dynamic user counts, and revamping the Pricing section with an interactive, cursor-animated background and a refined black-and-white theme. The engineer also addressed critical responsiveness issues observed on the production environment. The latest efforts concentrate on enhancing the Coming Soon section with a manually navigable carousel and a 'heartbeat' background animation.
